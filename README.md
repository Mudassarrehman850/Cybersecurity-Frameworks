# Cybersecurity-Frameworks
# What Is cyber security:
Cybersecurity refers to the practice of protecting internet-connected systems, including hardware, software, and data, from attack, damage, or unauthorized access. It involves implementing technologies, processes, and controls to secure systems and information from cyber threats such as hacking, malware, and data breaches.
# Goal:
The goal of cybersecurity is to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and technology systems.
# What is Cybersecurity Framework:
A cybersecurity framework is a set of guidelines and best practices for managing and protecting sensitive information and technology systems. It provides organizations with a common language and a structured approach for managing and reducing cyber risks, and helps to align cybersecurity activities with overall business goals. The framework outlines processes and controls for protecting information, networks, and systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction.
# Why Cybersecurity Framework:
- Cybersecurity frameworks are necessary because they provide a structured approach to managing and reducing cyber risks. These frameworks help organizations to understand the threats they face and to implement effective controls to mitigate those risks. They also provide a common language for communication about cyber risks and security controls, making it easier for organizations to collaborate and share information.

- Additionally, many industries have regulatory requirements for cybersecurity, and a framework provides a framework for compliance with these regulations. Finally, using a cybersecurity framework can demonstrate due diligence to stakeholders, including customers and shareholders, and can help organizations to build trust in their ability to protect sensitive information.
# Types:
Here are some of the most commonly used cybersecurity frameworks:

- **NIST Cybersecurity FrameworK:**
Improving critical Infrastructure cybersecurity to improve organization's risks by leveraging standard methadologies and processes.
- **ISO 27001/27002:**
Best practice recommendation for information security managment and information security program elements.
- **CIS-Critical Security Controls:**
Cyber protection that gives noteworthyapproaches to stop the present most inescapable attacks.
- **PCI-DSS:**
It is designed to protect credit card, debit card and cash card transaction.
